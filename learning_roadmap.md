# Where you can go with Elixir...

`syntax` LEARN [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) **THEN**

`logic` Create a [Mix project](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html#our-first-project) + 
PRACTICE with [Elixir's functions](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html) **THEN**
> I haven't found a source with an authoritative set of practice problems.

_I should create this. (including testing)_

> Just use any coding challenge site until you get the functional way of solving.

`logic` PRACTICE [algorithms && data structures](https://www.outco.io/#curriculum) (NEED BETTER LINK) in Elixir **OR**

_And I should create this. (including testing)_

`org` LEARN hardware [(Nerves)](https://nerves-project.org/) **OR**

`org` LEARN software [(Phoenix)](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4) **THEN**
> At this point, you're at parity with Rails. You can build any standard CRUD app.
> But the Elixir ecosystem is more powerful.

`org` LEARN GraphQL [(Absinthe)](https://pragprog.com/book/wwgraphql/craft-graphql-apis-in-elixir-with-absinthe) **OR**

`org` LEARN functional architecture [(OTP)](https://pragprog.com/book/lhelph/functional-web-development-with-elixir-otp-and-phoenix)

## Notes to Self
The reasoning to create this is going through all these resources (except Nerves), I now know the main 3 architectures for building Elixir projects.

Learning anything else, I should integrate it in terms of these foundations. Otherwise, I will lose track of what I know--i.e. writing this all out will help me learn it better _(provide the resource in the most frictionless way)_.

(So basically, finish my functional design project, and before starting another, create this--i.e. **alternate between project and documentation of what I learned**. Then try the [event sourcing](https://leanpub.com/buildingconduit/read#chapter-getting-started) project using Mnesia. And when I move forward, I can always scan [ElixirConf 2018 talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0l2QTnO1P2iph-86HHilMQ/videos) to decide what to attempt in a project next.)
