PRACTICE with [Elixir's functions](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html) **THEN**
> I haven't found a source with an authoritative set of practice problems.

_I should create this. (including testing)_

> Just use any coding challenge site until you get the functional way of solving.

`logic` PRACTICE [algorithms && data structures](https://www.outco.io/#curriculum) (NEED BETTER LINK) in Elixir **OR**
