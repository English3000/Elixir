  The end result will be that the `islands_display` (alpha tested in `svgs-practice`) frontend will have a functional rather than imperative design.

2. Additionally, I am exploring Elixir/simpler design patterns through this project.

  My purpose with a project is not just to rebuild something for a prospective employer, but rather to discover ways to minimize the friction between my having an idea and building it.

  Hence, I am seeking connection with technologies (and with people who can help to reduce that friction).

3. _After_ completing (1), the next step is to setup `page_controller.ex` to fetch game state based on a query string **[FIRST, explore all potential designs--as I did w/ `server.ex`]**
